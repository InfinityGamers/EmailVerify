# EmailVerify
The first mcpe email verification plugin!


Commands:
- /verifiy-token <token>
- /email-set <email>
- /email-set resend

How it works:
An user sets an email with "/email-set <email>" and the plugin will send an email to the one you set, but first it will ask you to confirm, because once you set it, you can't change it.

If you did not receive the verification email you need to run: "/email-set resend" to get it again.

The token will be 9 characters long. Once you get it, run "/verify-token <token>".

How do we send emails?:
Through our site made only for this plugin's purposes. If you wish to know how start a conversation with me on IM forums.

NOTICE: Tokens that are not verified within a week will be deleted.
